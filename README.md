The projects wanted me to assess the business requirements and system design requirements. For the clients program at drivers pass. The People at Drivers Pass goal was to help users pass their DMV drivers test. This is done through their lesson packages that provide the user with online tests and the ability to register for in-person lessons with their drivers.

Given more time, I would like to add more relations, actions, etc. to each of the diagrams provided in these assignments. While the diagrams I created gave a general idea, an actual diagram that you would want to utilize in proper production would require significantly more, or you would need multiple diagrams for multiple processes.

I gathered the users' needs by reading over the provided transcript of the conversation the Drivers Pass team members had with their stakeholders. I took the information from that transcript and then interpolated it into the system design requirements and business design requirements based on what needs were described by drivers past employees.

When I understand the desires of our clients and users, I can take the information provided from them and put them into various diagrams, such as class or sequence diagrams. Through these We can create the basis of which the program's new or entire functionality will be formed from. This is what these two projects culminated in.
